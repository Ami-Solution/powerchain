Offers are PowerDelivery contracts declaring:\r\n* Feed In Node (Producer/Generator)\r\n* Feed Out Node (Consumer/Endpoint)\r\n* Total Power (Power in Watt-Hours to be contracted)\r\n* Min Load (Minimum Load in Watt)\r\n* Peak Load (Maximum Load in Watt)\r\n* Bid Value (Ammount of \"currency\" to receive/spend)\r\n* Time Start (Starting Time of delivery)\r\n* Time End (End Time of delivery)\r\n* Role of Owner (Feed In or Feed Out)\r\n\r\nAs soon as a power delivery contract is visible from within the blockchain one other node may counter sign this contract.\r\n\r\n### Sign Power Delivery contract \r\n\r\nNodes are able to counter sign contracts. They are able to specify a lower/higher price.\r\n\r\nDuring signing a contract a test gets executed if both nodes are physically connected. \r\n  \r\n## Contributing\r\n- https://gitter.im/zoernert/powerchain\r\n- https://blog.stromhaltig.de/ ",
